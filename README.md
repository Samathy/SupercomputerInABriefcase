# Supercomputer in a Briefcase

## Introduction

Clearly it is impossible to fit a supercomputer in a briefcase. But it is a great label for the idea of
being able to construct ad hoc dynamic clusters of computers with a view to using them to play with
parallelism.

## The Stuff

This repository is for software to control and manage an ad hoc, dynamic cluster of computers.
